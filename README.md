# CleanRLHF

This project is focussed on implementing a framework for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback.

## üåê Structure

The **framework itself** is located in the [`framework`](https://github.com/jualat/CleanRLHF/tree/main/framework#readme) subdirectory together with a detailed description of the program as well as instructions to deploying it.

Additionally, we have created a **toolbox** to compare runs of the framework. The tool as well as its documentation can be found in the [`toolbox`](https://github.com/jualat/CleanRLHF/tree/main/toolbox#readme) subdirectory.
